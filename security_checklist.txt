# PWA Security Checklist

## Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS) Prevention
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to block iframe loading
- [ ] Set X-Frame-Options header to DENY or SAMEORIGIN
- [ ] Monitor server logs for unusually repetitive GET calls
- [ ] Implement user education resources about phishing attacks

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- [ ] Set proper Content Security Policy (CSP) to block SVG and SCRIPT tags
- [ ] Declare proper HTML lang attribute and charset (UTF-8)
- [ ] Perform regular code reviews to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Only use known and secure third-party libraries
- [ ] Serve third-party libraries locally after review instead of linking externally
- [ ] Monitor third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention
- [ ] Implement synchronizer token pattern (STP) for all forms
- [ ] Consider using Flask-WTF for built-in CSRF protection
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication for administrative operations
- [ ] Set up white-list firewall policies
- [ ] Implement server-side Content Security Policy

## SQL Injection Prevention
- [ ] Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
- [ ] Implement defensive data handling practices
- [ ] Require authentication before accepting any form input
- [ ] Update backend languages and libraries to latest secure versions
- [ ] Consider salting database table names
- [ ] Perform regular code reviews focused on SQL injection vectors

## API Security
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Enable HTTPS encryption for all API communication
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks (Flask-Limiter)
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings (Flask-CORS) with domain restrictions if possible
- [ ] Implement detailed logging of all API requests (HEAD, POST, GET)
- [ ] Validate all incoming data before processing

## General Security Measures
- [ ] Implement secure password storage with proper hashing and salting
- [ ] Set up proper session management with secure cookies
- [ ] Configure secure headers (X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Regularly backup database and application data
- [ ] Perform regular security audits and penetration testing
- [ ] Implement a security response plan for handling discovered vulnerabilities
- [ ] Keep all dependencies and libraries updated to address known vulnerabilities

## Specific Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Review main.py and user_management.py for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Check database queries for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Audit all forms in templates/ for proper validation and CSRF protection
- [ ] Review static/ resources for potential security issues
- [ ] Analyze requirements.txt to ensure all dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging for security monitoring
